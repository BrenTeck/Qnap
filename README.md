# Qnap intergration to home assistant

I have tested this and it works with the Qnap TS-412

The CPU temp does not work the TS-412 but the rest works fine both using SSL and without. Just make sure you get the settings right for you configuration.

You can copy and paste the card files to get it to display. I recommed you make a new UI window first so you do not lose auto update on the original Overview panel.
